# First Trade Profit
I posted in a [previous post](https://quintonn.github.io/blog/#!/entry/trading/sharing_my_trades) about my trading strategies and also my first public trade.  
The details of the trade is as follows:  
On 11 August, AMD was trading at around $78.65 and I sold 1 PUT with a strike of 76 and expiration date of 28 Aug 2020 for $259.
I also bought an AMD PUT with a strike of 75 and same expiration for $224. So in total I received $29.
On my platform I pay $3 per leg, so I only received $29 after fees.
On Friday, 28 August 2020, both legs expired worthless, and so nothing more had to be done and I got to keep the $29 of glorious profit.  

Basically, I risked losing $100 at most, and received $29 for that risk. But the $29 is mine to keep no matter what the outcome is, so actually I would not lose more than $71.  
That is essentially a 'return on risk' of 40%, in only 1 month. I condider that not too bad.

# Opportunity Cost
There is a bit of an opportunity cost, when selling bull put spread as I have done. And that is the potential profit I could have made if I bought a call option or shares instead of the same stock.  
AMD's price was around $79 when I made that trade, and it closed on Friday at 85.50. 
If I had just bought 100 shares of AMD and held them for the same period, I would have made about $5 per share, or $500 at least.  
But that would have required an investment of almost $7,900 and would have yielded only a 6% profit.  
Instead of shares, I could have also purchased a call option. A call option for the same period with a strike of $80 would have probably cost about $5 per share, so $500.  
And since the share price went up just over $5, it probably would have only yielded a small profit.  
On my next trade, I will document the cost of a call option to be able to make a better comparison.  
But a big difference between the bull put spread and buying a call option, is that once I buy the call option, the market has to change or move for me to make money.  
Whereas with the spread option, I receive money even before the market changes and I lose money, only if the market changes significantly.  
And I like this approach more. But I do monitor the price of the shares so as to notice when it's increasing at a rapid rate, because it might become worth buying call options instead.  

But for now, I'll keep selling the put spread.  

# Next Trade
I try and open a new trade whenever a previous one closed and I usually try to open it immediately if possible.  
For my next trade I would have liked to use the strikes of 80 and 79, but when the market opened on the 31st of August, AMD was already up $1.50 and those spreads would only have given me about $20.  
So, I will load the trade with those strikes for a value of about $35 and see if it gets executud in the next day or 2, else I need to choose higher strikes.  
The reason I choose $35 is because of the $6 in fees I also have to pay.   

This might again sound too good to be true. But one more thing to remember is that margin is required to place this trade.  
And on the platform I'm using, the margin for this trade is about $200. But that could go up to $2000 if the price of the share drops while I'm in the trade.  
And if the required margin exceeds the available cash in my account, my position will be closed and I will make a big loss.  
So it's important to pay attention to the required margins of your trading platform when placing these kinds of trades.  

I clever platform should recognize the spread trade and require only $100 in margin, but mine doesn't do that.  

# Following Along
I mentioned in my previous post that I would share my trades going forward.  
I will document all my trades in a Google Sheets document that can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KIFW4zDYF60cLwgFfQjCby8O29dk0VqOvyC4BroFIxM/edit?usp=sharing)  
I will include both winners and losers of both the put spreads and any dividend shares I decide to purchase.

# RISK
If you've read this far, thank you for reading my blog.  
I would like to remind you, dear reader, that trading options (CALLs and PUTs) is extremely risky and it is possible to lose more money than you invested or have available.  
So, unless you fully understand and accept the risk, do not attempt to make options trades.  
And do not make any trades based solely on the information from my blog posts, as I am not an authorized or professional trader or financial advisor.
