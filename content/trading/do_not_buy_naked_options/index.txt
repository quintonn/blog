# So, Don't Buy Naked Options!
Unless you have inside knowledge or following a specific, proven, trading plan or strategy, there is really **no reason** to buy naked options.  
I'm not going to discuss selling options, but it is even riskier to sell naked options, and again, unless you **know** what you are doing, **don't** sell naked options.

If you are planning on buying options, you should be buying [Bull Call Spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullcallspread.asp) or a [Bear Put Spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearputspread.asp).  

# Reasoning
If you're still following a long, you are no doubt asking the very importing question, **why not?**  

I won't blame you if you are thinking that with naked options you can make **more** money, a lot more.  
Buying naked options allows for **unlimited** profit, and buying option spreads limits the profit potential.  

And this used to be my thinking too.  
But, once you put **greed** aside, and apply **logic**, you will see why option spreads, make so much more sense.

# Some Basic Maths
It all comes down to **probability** and **risk.**  
I am very risk-averse when it comes to investments and trading.  
I don't like risky endeavours, at all.  

When considering a naked option versus an option spread, you have to ask yourself, what is the probability that your [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) will be reached,
and how much higher (or lower) does the price need to go, before you make a profit?

**Two** very important components of options trading are the **strike price** and the [option premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp)  
When buying an option, the price of the underlying has to reach your option's strike price + the premium for you to just **break-even**, not even make a profit yet.  
In other words, the market has to move **significantly** before you even start making any profits, never mind **huge profits** or the imaginary **unlimited profits.**  

In addition to all of that, naked options can be quite **expensive.**  

On the other hand, with an option spread, your profit is **limited**, but your cost is much less.  

# An Example
It is probably best to illustrate with an example.  
I will use **Netflix** as an example.  

The current price, as of this writing, of Netflix, is **$424.**  

## The Naked Call
Let's say we want to buy a **call option** on Netflix with a **strike** price of $425 and with an **expiration date** of 18-Dec-2020, that's a 200 day call options.  

The current option premium for this call option is a wopping **$54** give or take a few dollars.  
I.E. the cost of buying 1 call option is $5,400.  

So what does that mean?  
It means the price of Netflix has to reach about **$476** before we start making any profit.  
And let's **assume** Netflix does reach as high as $500, that will be a profit of about $2,000-$3,000.  That is a change in price of almost 20%.  
If our initial investment was $5,400 and we made an optimistic $3,000 profit, that's a **55%** **return on investment.**  
It might seem high, but it's quite a big risk.  

One **advantage** of a naked call over a call spread is that you could sell your call option at **any time** if it has gained value.  
This is something that might happen from time to time as a result of major news or earnings posted.

## The Call Spread
Now, let's compare a call spread.  

For the call spread, we will buy the same call option: Strike of $425, expiring 18-Dec-2020 at a cost of about $54.  
But with the spread, we will sell a call option with a strike of $450, same expiry at a premium of about $43.  

That results in a total cost of about $11, or $1,100 for the final trade.  
That gives us a maximum profit potential of about **$1,400**.  ($2,500 - $1,100).  

But what will be different?  
Firstly, our initial investment is about 20% of the naked call trade.  
Second, for us to reach maxmimum profit, the price of **Netflix** only has to reach $450, instead of $500.  
That's a change in price of about **6%**, that's a lot less than the 20% change required for the naked option.  

That would result in a **ROI** of about **125%!**  

So that means a call spread carries **less risk** and a potential **higher profit** rate.  
There is obviously the **posibility** that the naked call could yield **much higher** profits, but as I stated at the beginning, what is the **probability** of that happening?  

A somewhat **major** disadvantage of this strategy though, is that you have to hold both options until **expiration** in order to yield maximum profit.  

# Risk & Reward
Ultimately it all comes down to **risk vs reward** and how comfortable you are with your trading decisions and strategies.  

But I do believe it is better to buy option spreads rather than naked options, unless one believes a stock will move a **significant** amount, in which case, just go naked! :)
