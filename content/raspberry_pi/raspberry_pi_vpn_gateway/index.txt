# Why?

I bought a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) about a year ago and have been playing around with it trying various things, but didn't have anything to really use it for.

**Until now!**

Having lived and worked in a number of different countries over the last couple of years, I ended up buying various electronics and gadgets in all sorts of different countries.

As a result, many of those devices were registered or set up in those different places.

And this has led me to a situation where I have an XBOX linked to the Microsoft store in one country, 
my phone linked to the Google Play Store in another country, 
my wife's iPhone in yet another country and some other devices linked with possibly even more places.

On top of that, it is sometimes better to browse the internet while being connected to a VPN. For example when searching for travel deals.

As a temporary solution, we signed up to a VPN provider for approximately **$10** a month.  
This allows us to have a VPN on up to five devices and set the country we want to "be" in while browsing the internet.

As I said, this works fine, but doesn't work quite well on the XBOX or some other devices. 

And I just wanted a reason to play with my Pi.

# The Network

What I wanted to achieve is the following:  

1. Have my **XBOX** connect to my **Raspberry Pi** using a network cable.
2. Have the Raspberry Pi connect to the VPN.
3. Connect the Raspberry Pi the my network router over wifi.
4. Share the internet from the wifi on the Raspberry Pi with my XBOX, over the network cable.

This looks more or less as follows:

What this would allow me to do is to play and purchase XBOX games as if I am physically in the country where I bought my XBOX without having to change my region
or change my payment methods and who knows what else.  

This is a silly problem to have in my opinion, I don't understand why all the market places and app stores restrict access based on **physicall** location.  

What happens when people just go on holiday and take their devices with them?  
Are they then not allowed to buy apps and games in those different countries?  

And that is why I wanted to have my Raspberry Pi serve as a VPN gateway to my XBOX and possibly other devices in the future.

# The Setup

The solution ended up being **A LOT** easier than I thought.  

I am a software developer and I consider myself quite competent when it comes to computers and stuff, but when it comes to Linux and networking, 
I am quite a novice.  

But I am an expert at using **Google.**

So, with my internet searching super power, I managed to come up with a solution, after many hours of trial and error.

I used a Raspberry Pi 3B for this, and these instructions might not work exactly the same for other models, but this might give you a good starting point.

I found most of my solution from [this](https://gist.github.com/trepidacious/ef3d68014258843944e3df0570876031) github gist by [trepidacious](https://gist.github.com/trepidacious).

After obtaining my Raspberry Pi I installed the [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) Operating System which is the recommended 
operating system for a Raspberry Pi.

For the setup to work, you will need your wifi's IP range and the router's IP address, which is usually something like **192.168.X.1**.

With this information in hand, open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi, or **SSH** into it.

The first task is to setup all the network interfaces on the Raspberry Pi. To do this, run the following command to open the **Interfaces** file:
```     
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

And set the content of this file as follows:  
**Note how I put my eth0 interface on a different IP range!**
```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.Z.33
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    dns-nameservers 192.168.X.1

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
    wpa-ssid "XXXX"
    wpa-psk "XXXXX"
    address 192.168.X.20
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.X.1
    dns-nameservers 192.168.X.1
```

Press Ctrl+X to quit the file, and don't forget to press "Y" to save the changes.

As I said, I am no expert in Linux or networking, but I assume this sets up the different networks my Raspberry Pi connects to and also assigns it static 
IP address on both the ethernet and the Wifi. The wifi static detail is probably not required, come to think of it. But it's working for now so I will leave it.

Next, edit another file by executing this command:
```     
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

And set it's content as follows:
```
sudo iptables -t nat -A  POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT
```

Now this file is pretty much a mystery to me.  
I copy-pasted most of it and modified various values until it worked.  

I am guessing these command tells the Raspberry Pi to **forwards** traffic between the VPN (tun0) and the wifi (wlan0).  
But what exactly it does, I'm not too sure.

And after setting all of this, restart the Raspberry Pi with the following command: 
```
sudo reboot
```

Next, all that is left is to connect the VPN on the Raspberry Pi, and connect the XBOX.  

Connecting the VPN depends on what VPN provider you have, but for me it was as simple as running 1 command to connect to the country of my choice.

Connect the XBOX and the Raspberry Pi using a network cable and then configure the IP address settings for the XBOX as follows:

On the XBOX, choose to set the network settings manually, and enter the following (or similar) information:  
**IP Address:** 192.168.Z.66  
**Netmask:**    255.255.255.0  
**gateway:**    192.168.Z.33  
**DNS Server:** 192.168.X.1  

And once the XBOX resets it's network information, it should be connected to the internet over the VPN on the Raspberry Pi.  
You can confirm this by opening the internet browser on the XBOX and typing "What is my ip address" in the search box.  
It should show that you are in the country that you connected your VPN to.  

Now you can play or buy games as if you were in the country where you purchased your XBOX, or other device.
