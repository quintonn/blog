# QBic
For the last number of years, I've been building my own .NET platform, or framework, to help me build web-based applications.  
A .NET Framework-Framework, if you will.  

I often have ideas related to software or technology that I want to test out, and more often than not they require some kind of user-interface and database.  

For a long time, I would just try and quickly throw something together or copy something I've done before, but it would always take me a lot longer to build the non-essential parts, 
that by the time I got to actually testing out my idea I'm already exhausted or forgot what I wanted to do.

So, like most software developers, I looked at what was available.  
And there were many different kinds of solutions and tools, but all the ones I looked were either too expensive, or required too much customization, or was too bulky for small projects, or, or, or...  

At the time, I was also not very comfortable with **JavaScript**, **HTML** or **CSS**, and I thought it would be quite neat if I didn't have to write any of that.  
Or, at least, if I could write it only once.  

So, about 5 or 6 years ago I decided to create my own framework.  
I guess you can say it is a **CMS** (Content Management System).  
But I believe it's more than that.  

I wanted something that could allow me to test out my ideas as quickly as possible, and by writing as few lines of code as possible.  
Something that would allow me to click a button and run immediately without having to write a single line of code.  
And then be able to write only the code I **needed** to write.  

In the end I created ~~Project 1~~, ~~Project 2~~, ~~WebSite~~, ~~WebTemplate~~, ..., **QBic**.  

I find it's always best to show some examples before getting into the details.  
So here are a few example screens that **QBic** creates for me, without me having to write any **HTML** or **JavaScript** code.

### Login Screen

### Example View

### Input Screen Samples

![Input Sample 2](Input_Sample_2.png "Example Input Screen #2")

All of these screens are created for every new **QBic** project without writing **any** front-end code such as JavaScript, HTML or CSS!  

# What's Next?

I've been considering, and trying, to monetize this framework for a while, but I have not been very successful.  
So I decided to open source it!  

The source code for this project is over at [GitHub](https://github.com/quintonn/QBic) and I have also created a Git repository with some [samples](https://github.com/quintonn/QBicSamples) of what can be built using **QBic**.  
I plan to add more content to the samples project as well as add more documentation.  

Currently, there are a ton of features, but most of them are hidden quite deep, and they're only in the code and in my head, well some of them at least.  

The code is now open-source and available for anyone.  
Even though this framework makes building a web server quite easy, there are still a small number of steps to set things up.  
It's not that much at all, and I don't really see a way to reduce those steps.  

But, I also created Visual Studio project template that allows me to create a new **QBic** project, build the code once and hit F5 to run the project and I am presented with a login screen.  
But I have decided not to give this away for free, and I plan on making this available for a small fee in the near future.  

But in the meantime I would love to see what other people create using **QBic**.
