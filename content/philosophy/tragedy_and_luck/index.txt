# When Tragedy Strikes
Over the weekend, there was a **car accident** in my town, on the main street in the centre of the country's capital.  
The driver was way over the speed-limit when he jumped a red-light, hitting 2 other cars.  
The driver and his passenger are both alive, but **sadly**, the same can't be said for the passengers of the other vehicles involved.  

This sort of event is big news in the country of Moldova, where I live, and even though I don't really follow local news, this will most likely make headlines in the days to come.  

This is obviously a **tragic event.**  
But this will not make headlines for the obvious reason, this will make headlines because racing and reckless driving in the city is a **common occurrence.**  
And locals are frequently raising their concerns and frustrations about this.  

And as sad as it sounds, I don't anything is going to **change** in the near future.  

# This Is Not Uncommon
Accidents like this probably happen all the time, all over the world.  
Accidents that could be avoided by authorities and governments being less careless and irresponsible, especially towards the "smaller" crimes, such as speeding, 
petty theft and many other similar crimes.  

Another commonality with events such as the accident in Chisinau this weekend, is that people will **react** to this kind of news.  
People will lash out on social media about how angry and upset they are and how things should be done and laws changed and so on and so forth.  

But, **no one** will really **do** anything.  
Besides for possibly immediate and direct **family and friends** of the people affected, no-one will go on a march or protest, no one will risk their jobs and livelyhood over something like this, 
and no-one is willing to **upset the balance** of their existence in persuit of justice.  

And I believe there is a reason for that.  
And that reason is similar to how we react to luck.  

# When Fortune Strikes
On the other side of the coin there is fortune, good luck.  

How do we react when someone else gets a promotion, or if someone else gets married or has a baby.  
Or, how do people react when someone they know wins the lottery!

When hearing about someone else's good fortune, we are initially happy for them, but unless we are direct family or very close friends, that joy or hapiness is soon replaced by the normality of life.  
Because our lives go on the same. We did not get a promotion or have a babby or win the lottery. 

And I think people react in this way, to both fortune and tragedy, for the same reason...  

And that reason is **randomness!**

# Randomness
What are the odds of winning the lottery?  
What are the odds of being in a car accident?

The odds are probably very similar.  
And I think this is the reason we don't see protests or marches to stop street racing, or protests to make government catch people who drink and drive,
or protests to stop people from spreading diseases, and the list goes on.  

Everyone knows they **might** be in a car accident because of a **drunk driver**.  
We know we **might** catch a deadly disease.  

But we also know, theoretically, we might get a promotion, or even win the lottery.   
But we don't get all excited and happy just because there is a possibility. **No!**  
We only get excited if it **actually** happens to us, or maybe to someone **very** close to us.  

And it's the same with bad news, or **tragedy.**  
Only once it happens to us, are we willing and motivated to do something about it.  
But, by then it's too late. We have already suffered.  

And no matter how hard one might try, it will be near impossible to convince others to join in the fight or the struggle.  
Because, it was an act of **randomness.**  

As long as people feel or believe it was just bad luck, it is not something they will act upon.  
It was bad luck that person was in that car, crossing that street, at that time, on that day.  
It was **bad luck!**
