    <block>
        <pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html code-sample inline-block" name="sample_code.html "></code></pre>

    </block>

<section heading="Lists">
    <block>
        It is possible to create different kinds of lists.
        <br />
        The first is a numbered list, and the second is more custom list.
        <br />
        Below are both examples
        <list type="number">
            <list-item>
                This is a numbered list item
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
                This is another item in the list
            </list-item>
        </list>
        <list min-width="150px">
            <list-item heading="Custom 1">
                This is a custom list item
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Can be Anything">
                And this is another custom list item. Notice the heading can be anything and how it is different from a numbered list on small devices.
                Try resizing your screen to notice the difference
            </list-item>
        </list>
