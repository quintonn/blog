        As someone in the IT industry, it is almost insulting to me when I receive a profressional email and it is from <span class="font-bold">"someone@gmail.com."</span>
    </block>
    <block>
        It would be much better to receive an email from "john@CoolNewProject.com", would it not?
    </block>
    <block>
        The same applies to Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, or any similar, free, email provider.

    <block>
        If someone sends me a professional email, maybe trying to advertise their product, or to discuss a project, or whatever the case may be,
        if they are using a free email service, it means they are too greedy or lazy to setup a custom email account.
        And yet they are expecting me to to give my time to help with their project or spend money on whatever they are trying to sell me.
    </block>
    <block>
        And what makes it even worse, is that a custom email account can be set up from <span class="font-bold">$1.99</span> per year.
    </block>

        Would you trust an email from your bank if it was sent from a Gmail account?
        <br />
        Or an email for a competition you won?
        <br />
        No! You would most probably think it is some kind of scam.
        <br />
        And the same happens if you send an email using Gmail, Hotmail, etc to other people.
        <br />
        They might think you are unprofessional, or even worse, a scammer or con artist.
    </block>
    <block>
        But most people can't be blamed, because emails and domains and internet things are all techincal and complicated and difficult and 1000 other excuses, right?
    </block>
    <block>
        Not anymore, I believe anyone who can setup a gmail account, can also set up a custom email domain and have emails that are 100 times more professional.

<section heading="How To Setup a Custom Email Domain">
    <block>
        The first thing you need for a custom email account, is a domain.
        <br />
        This is what is going to make your emails seem more professional.
        <br />
        A domain is the part of an email address after the <span class="font-bold">@</span> symbol.
        <br />
        <span class="font-bold">For example:</span> google.com, quintonnsBlog.com, freeMoney.org, greatproject.info, something.online, thisIsReal.xyz, are all valid domains.
    </block>
    <block>
        After you have a domain, you will need to set up an email service to be able to send and receive emails to and from your new domain.
        <br />
        This is the more technical part, but it is a lot easier than you might think.
    </block>
    <block>
        Below I will show how I am able to setup these things from as little as $1.99 per <span class="font-bold">year.</span>

<section heading="Getting a Custom Domain">
    <block>
        Getting your own domain is quite easy and relatively cheap, but it does depend on the name you choose, as some domains are more expensive than others.
    </block>
    <block>
        To get a domain, you need to purshase one from a Domain Name Registrar.
        <br />
        If that sounds technical and complicated, don't worry, it is actually a lot easier than it sounds.
    </block>
    <block>
        There are a ton of Domain Name Registrars online, and a simple internet search for where to buy a domain will reveal many options.
    </block>
    <block>
        I currently use <web-link link="https://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</web-link> to register domains.
        <br />
        They make it quite easy.
        <br />
        You can even find out if the domain you want is available for purchase and how much it will cost before having to sign up or
        provide any personal information and choose a payment method.
    </block>
    <block>
        It might take some creative thinking and expirimentation to find a name that is both cheap and available,
        but once you find the name you like, you can register and purchase your domain.
    </block>
    <block>
        As I mentioned, there are many alternatives to GoDaddy, and you should shop around as prices might differ and some registrars might offer
        various promotions.
        <br />
        Having said that, it is better to go with one of the more well known registrars, because it is much easier to find help guides
        and documenation for them, as this is something that might be important in the next step to setting up custom email.

        The next step is to be able to send and receive emails using your new domain.
    </block>
    <block>
        For this part, I discovered <web-link link="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail.</web-link>
        <br />
        And the reason I like them, is because they have a free plan and they have comprehensive set up guides to make this process quite easy.
    </block>
    <block>
        On the Zoho website, you need to choose the Business Email option.
    </block>
    <block>
        After doing that you will be presented with 3 options for different paid plans.
        <br />
        But if you <span class="font-bold">scroll down</span>, there is a <span class="font-bold">free forever</span> plan.
        <br />
        Choose that plan, if you are on a budget or just want to test things out. Otherwise, choose the plan that suits your needs or expectations.
    </block>
    <block>
        Next, you will have to enter the domain you purchases earlier (eg, myFlowerShop.com).
    </block>
    <block>
        Then you will need to provide some registration details, including your current email address (gmail) and a name for you administration account,
        which will become your first email address at your new domain.
    </block>
    <block>
        Once you have registered you will need to confirm your email address.
        <br />
        And after that, you will be able to log in and view your dashboard or control panel.
    </block>
    <block>
        In the control panel, or dashboard, you should see an option to view your <span class="font-bold">domains.</span>
        <br />
        If you select that option, you should see the domain listed there that you entered during registration.
    </block>
    <block>
        There are a number of steps to configure your new domain with Zoho mail and get email working.
        <br />
        But I am not going to list them here again, as I think Zoho mail does an excelent job of that.
        <br />
        You should see a help section below your domain in the Zoho dashboard, with instructions for setting up <span class="font-bold">MX Records.</span>
    </block>
    <block>
        If you click on the link for instructions to setup MX Records, you will be shown a list of different DNS providers, and GoDaddy is one of them.
        <br />
        Click on GoDaddy, or your DNS provider, and follow the steps to set up the MX Records to be able to receive emails with your new domain.
    </block>
    <block>
        There are a number of steps to complete to get emails setup with your domain, most of which involve copy-pasting values from Zoho to GoDaddy, or your DNS provider.
        <br />
        But it is a <span class="font-bold">once-off investment</span>, after which you will have a professional looking email address.
    </block>

<section heading="For The Adventurous">
    <block>
        Now that you have a custom domain, for example <span class="font-bold">myflowershop.com</span>,
        you may have wondered whether or you now also have a website.
    </block>
    <block>
        Well, you won't have a website, but you already have everything in place to create a website for yourself.
    </block>
    <block>
        But, just as with emails, you could easily set up a website for your new custom domain.
        <br />
        And, this can also be done for <span class="font-bold">free.</span>
    </block>
    <block>
        I will not be going into details on how to set up a custom website in this post, but there are many options available for doing that.
        <br />
        A free and easy option is to use <web-link link="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</web-link>, which is how I host this blog site.
        <br />
        More information about doing that can be found <web-link link="https://quintonn.github.io/InstaBlog/#!/entry/sample/using_insta_blog">here.</web-link>
    </block>
    <block>
        For a very professional looking landing page or home page, I also recommend taking a look at <web-link link="https://carrd.co/">Carrd.</web-link>
        <br />
        They also provide a free plan, and by modifying your DNS provider MX records, you can also have this work with your custom domain for free.
