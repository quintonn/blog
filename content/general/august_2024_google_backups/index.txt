# Setting Up Automatic Google Backups In A QBic Application

This post will show how to set up automatic backups in a QBic application and store them in a Google Drive folder.  

Follow along with the steps provided.  

## Google Configuration
To start, you will need to make some changes to an existing Google account.  
Basically, you will need a Google **gmail** account for this to work.  

Once you have a **gmail** account, head over to [the google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  

On this page, you should see a **Welcome** screen.  

In the top left there should be a drop-down.  
Click on the drop-down, which should open a window.  
From there, select **New Project**.  

![New Project](image_1.png "New Project")  

Once you click the **New Project** button, a new window will show up where you need to enter a project name.  
Enter a project name and click **Create**.  

![Project Name](image_2.png "Project Name")  

This may take a few seconds and a notification should show that the project has been created.  

There should also be a notification window with the option to **select project**.  
If this does not show up, you can click the same drop-down menu in the top-left as before and select the project you just created.  

Once you've chosen your project, from the dashboard, choose **APIs & Services".  

![APIs & Services](image_3.png "APIs & Services")  

From the APIs & Services page, click to **Enable APIs and Services**.  

![Enable APIs & Services](image_4.png "Enable APIs & Services")  

Once you enable the APIs and Service, you should be presented with a new screen:  

![APIs & Services](image_5.png "APIs & Services")  

In the search bar at the top, enter **Google Drive API**  and hit the return, or "enter" key.  

This should show a list of results, one of them being the **Google Drive API**  

![Google Drive API](image_6.png "Google Drive API")  

Click on the **Google Drive API** option.  

This will show a new screen.  

On the new screen, there should be a button labeled "Enabled", click on that.  

![Enable Google Drive API](image_7.png "Enable Google Drive API")  

This will then do some things on the screen and after a few seconds a new screen will appear with details about the **Google Drive API**.  

Next, on the left, in the menu, should be an option called **Credentials**.  
Click on that.  

![Credentials](image_8.png "Credentials")  

On the top of the **Credentials** page should be an option to **Create Credentials**.  
Click on that.  
This will show a few options.  
Choose the option called **Service Account**.  

![Service Account](image_9.png "Service Account")  

This will show a new screen where you have to enter details for the service.  

Here you will need to enter a **Service account name**.  
Enter a name, and click **Create and Continue**.  
When you enter a name, another field called "Serviec Account ID" will automatically be filled in.  
Don't change that field.  

When you click on the **Create and Continue** button, it will ask you to select a role.  
You can type in the filter box to search for **Owner**.  

![Account & Role](image_10.png "Account & Role")  

Select the **Owner** role, and click **Continue**.  

On the next screen you don't need to do anything.  
Simply click **Done**.  

A service account will now be created and you should see the home screen again, with your new account listed.  

On this screen, click on the **pencil** icon on the far right:  

![Edit Account](image_11.png "Edit Account")  

This will show a new screen.  
There should be a menu bar on the top, with an option for **Keys**.  
Click on that, and then select **Add Key** and select **Create New Key**.  

![Create Key](image_12.png "Create Key")  

This will open another screen, where you should select the **JSON** option, and click **Create**.  

![Create JSON Key](image_13.png "Create JSON Key")  

This should create and **download** a JSON file.  
A notification should pop-up in your browser.  
If nothing pops up, you may need to check permissions and settings in your browser.  
There is usually a warning somewhere in the browser, so you may need to look carefully.  

![Download JSON Key](image_14.png "Download JSON Key")  

After the key is downloaded, there is one more step.  
Click on the **Credentials** menu on the left of the screen again.  

This should show the main credentials screen again.  

Now, note down the **email address** that has been created for you service account:  

![Email Address](image_19.png "Email Address")  

This concludes all the setup that needs to be done in your Google account.  

## Google Drive Setup

The next step is to open the ![Google Drive website](https://drive.google.com/drive/home).  

Here you need to open, or create & open, a Google drive folder where you want backups to be saved.  

In the left of the screen, should be a menu option called **My Drive**, click on that.  

Then, right click in the blank, white area, and select **New Folder**.  

![New Folder](image_15.png "New Folder")  

You can create as many folders, similarly to how you can create folders on your computer or laptop.  

Once you have created, or selected, the folder where you want to store the backups, you need to get the folder's ID.  

This is done by opening the folder, or double clicking on the folder.  
Once you have opened the folder, look at the **URL**, or address bar in your browser.  
From there, copy the folder's ID from the address bar, as follows:  

![Folder ID](image_17.png "Folder ID")  

In the example above, the **folder ID** is "1v1QygmFEYrvbe2wLuOc8k0r7sCX-fYw_".  

Copy this folder ID to a file or note it down for later.  

Next, we need to make sure the backup folder is shared with the service account that was created earlier.  

Inside the folder you created for the backups, click on the name at the top, and click on **share**.  

![Share](image_20.png "Share")  

This should open a window where you can enter email addresses.  
Here, enter the email address of the **service account** that you created earlier, and click **send**.  

![Share & Send](image_21.png "Share & Send")  

## QBic Setup

Next, in your QBic application, open the settings menu.  

There should be a tab called **Google Backups**.  

![Settings](image_16.png "Settings")  

On this screen you need to enter some details from the previous steps.  

Firstly, enter the application name, which is the same as the **service** name we created previously.  
Next, the **parent folder** field should be set to the folder created in **Google Drive**.  
Then lastly, the **Credential File** should be the file that was downloaded when you created the **JSON Key**.  

![Settings With Detail](image_18.png "Settings With Detail")  

Once you've entered the required information, click submit.  

And that should be all.  

## Confirm Backups Are Made

It might take up to 24 hours before backups are made and saved to your Google Drive.  

Once backups are made, you should see them in the **Google Drive** folder you created in previous steps:
