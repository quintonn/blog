        There are has been a lot of movement of players since last season, and it's the first thing worth mentioning.
    </block>
    <block>
        New players joined Super Rugby, some have left, some have returned from clubs abroad, and some have moved from one team to another.
    </block>
    <block>
        Below are some of the changes this season.
    </block>

    <bio-item align="left" heading="Ox Nché" url="ox.jpg" image-caption="Image: Planet Rugby" image-source="https://www.planetrugby.com/ox-prepared-to-wait-his-turn">
        Retshegofaditswe 'Tshego', or Ox as he is more commonly known, moved to the Sharks from the Cheetahs, who haven't been part of the Super Rugby competition for a number of years.
        Ox is a great scrummager with a surprising burst of speed.
        Will be good to see how he fares against Super Rugby opposition.
        With the Beast retiring, Ox will have plenty of game-time.

    <bio-item align="right" heading="Josh Strauss" url="josh.png" image-caption="Image: SA Rugby Mag" image-source="https://www.sarugbymag.co.za/bulls-claim-comfortable-warm-wins">
        Moved back from Scotland to join the Sharks.
        Previously the captain of the Lions when they were successfull in the Curry Cup in 2011,
        it will be interesting to see if Josh can bring back that form and character that led the Lions to Curry Cup glory.

    <bio-item align="left" heading="Madosh Tambwe" url="madosh.jpg" image-caption="Image: sportsleo" image-source="https://sportsleo.com/rugby/sharks-announce-signing-lions-winger-madosh-tambwe-sports-leo/">
        Moved from the Lions to the Sharks.
        This was maybe not the best move for Madosh as the sharks have Mapimpi and Nkosi as starting wings,
        so Madosh might get even less play time than he did at the lions.
        But maybe this is a good opportunity for him to learn from the best.

    <bio-item align="right" heading="Andries Ferreira" url="andries.jpg" image-caption="Image: flipboard" image-source="https://flipboard.com/topic/southafricanews/super-rugby-2019%3A-south-african-lock-andries-ferreira-reportedly-headed-to-hurri/f-d2bd622390%2Fco.nz">
        Another Lions player that moved to the Sharks.
        A bulky ball carrier that does a lot of off-the-ball work, will surely be missed at the Lions.

    <bio-item align="left" heading="Willem Alberts" url="willem.jpg" image-caption="Image: Pinterest" image-source="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/423197696204081108/">
        Back from Europe, the gentle giant, also known as "the Bone Collector" is back at the Lions where he started his career.
        The Lions have not had a big loose forward in recent years, so this might give them a big ball carrier,
        especially with Andries Ferreira having moved to the Sharks.

        Other players to mention are:
        <list min-width="150px">
            <list-item heading="Morné Steyn">
                The darling of Loftus is back home where it all started for him. He might be just what the Bulls need to return them to winning ways.
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Jannie du Plessis">
                Jannie is one of the players returning home from Europe, but surprisingly not to the Sharks where he started, but to the Lions.
                Jannie certainly offers a lot of experience and hopefully he can guide some of the youngsters at the Lions.
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Harry Potter">
                I couldn't resist mentioning this player as a new member of the Rebels. It will be interesting to see what kind of magic he can conjure in the backline.
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Beauden Barrett">
                Beauden has decided to move to the Blues from the Hurricanes in a bit of a surprising move.
                It will be interesting to see if he can continue the form he showed at the 'Canes.
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Aaron Cruden">
                Aaron returns to New Zealand to play for the Chiefs after spending some time abroad.
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Warren Gatland">
                Another worthy mention is the former Welsh coach taking the reins at the Chiefs.
                He will bring a lot to the Chiefs setup and I will be keeping my eye on this team.
            </list-item>
            <list-item heading="Jaco Kriel">
                This former inspirational Lions player returns home after a couple of years abroad.
                If he can return his previous form it will be a welcome return for the Lions who have lost many experienced players in recent years.
            </list-item>
        </list>
        There are obviously many other players who have joined and left the various teams, but I chose to mention a couple that stand out to me.

<section heading="First Impressions">
    <block>
        Even though it's only the first week of the competition, there are already clear signs of things to come.
    </block>
    <block>
        The best results from the first weekend are without a double from the Crusaders and the Stormers, with both teams scoring good tries from both running rugby and from set-piece.
    </block>
    <block>
        Just how good these performances were will only be clear after a few more games, but the way these 2 teams played was impressive.
    </block>
    <block>
        The Stormers showed that they are eager to play good old-fashioned running rugby, with the ball being distributed to the backline very early in the game.
        Not only did they show a lot on attack, but also a very strong defensive system, reacting very quickly to the opposition and putting tremendous presssure on the Hurricanes.
        It is hard to believe the Hurricanes had players like Ben Lamb, Ngani Laumape and Jordie Barrett on the field, because they hardly ever saw the ball.
        With all the pressure being placed on the Hurricanes, it is not surprise that they conceded 2 yellow cards on the day.
    </block>
    <block>
        Two standout players for the Stormers were Pieter-Steph du Toit (PSdT) and Herschel Jantjies with both players being present at every break-down, ruck and maul and constantly putting pressure on the Hurricanes.
        And, to no surpirse, Herchel even managed to cross the try-line.
    </block>
    <block>
        Some bad news for the Stormers are the injuries to Bongi and Siya Kolisi, hopefully nothing too serious.
    </block>
    <block>
        The Crusaders equally showed that they will once again be a force in the competition and why they are the defending champions.
        Their ball-handling skills, running lines and interplay between the backs and the forwards was by far better than any of the other teams.
    </block>
    <block>
        Most teams showed many signs of rust after the off-season, but the Crusaders looked like they were playing in their 7th or 8th game already.
    </block>
    <block>
        Of all the Crusaders' players, Jack Goodhue was the most impressive. He ran great lines, distributed the ball well to his outside-backs, defended and communicated well, and will surely be one of the top performers this season.
        It's hard to imaging he is only 24 years old. He playes with the maturity of a much older player.

<section heading="Looking Forward...">
    <block>
        The rest of the season promises to deliver some very exciting rugby with a lot of youngsters already showing that they as good, if not better, than most of the older, more well-known, players.

        May the best team win!
