    <block>
        This is my personal blog.

    <block>
        I decided to start this blog mostly so I have a place to write down my thoughts and ideas.

        I enjoy a wide variety of things, including Rugby, Programming, Technology, Investing & Shares, Fishing, Playing Golf, and many more.

        This blog will be a place where I can save my thoughts and opinions on many things, so I may refer back to it later and maybe even update them.

        This blog started as a side project of mine where I wanted to see if I could build a blogging engine that would be easy to run and host.
        <br />
        And as a result, this blog might change and receive updates from time to time and may not always be available.
